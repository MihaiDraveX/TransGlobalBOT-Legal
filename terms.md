## 2. Eligibility & Accounts
You must be permitted to use Discord and have the authority to configure apps for any server in which you enable the Application. Server owners are responsible for managing roles, permissions, and access granted to the Application.

## 3. License & Access
We grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive license to use the Service solely on Discord and in accordance with these Terms. We may update, suspend, or discontinue any feature at any time with or without notice.

## 4. Acceptable Use
You may not:
- Use the Service for illegal activities, harassment, spam, or evasion of platform restrictions.  
- Interfere with or disrupt the Service, circumvent rate limits, or probe infrastructure.  
- Misrepresent your affiliation or misuse TransGlobalBOT’s name, branding, or identity.  
- Collect or export data from the Service in violation of privacy or platform rules.

## 5. Your Content & Permissions
Commands you invoke may reference user IDs, role IDs, or limited message context to perform actions. You retain rights in your content. By using the Service, you grant us the permissions necessary to process your content for the limited purpose of providing the features you enable.

## 6. Configuration & Data
Server configuration (e.g., channel/role IDs, convoy/event settings) is stored only as needed to operate features. Operational logs are short-lived and used for reliability and security. See the **[Privacy Policy](privacy.md)** for details.

## 7. Third-Party Services
The Service may interact with Discord APIs and hosting providers. We are not responsible for third-party services and do not control their terms or privacy practices.

## 8. Changes & Availability
We aim for high availability but provide no absolute uptime guarantee. Features may change or be deprecated. We will post material changes to these Terms or the Privacy Policy on this site.

## 9. Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.” TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

## 10. Limitation of Liability
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, OR GOODWILL. OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF **USD $100** OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID US (IF ANY) IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.

## 11. Indemnification
You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Service and its operators from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.

## 12. Termination
You may remove the Application from your server at any time. We may suspend or terminate access for any violation of these Terms or to protect the Service or its users.

## 13. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of **[Germany]**, without regard to conflict-of-law rules. Before formal proceedings, the parties will try to resolve disputes informally in good faith within 30 days of notice. Nothing here prevents either party from seeking urgent injunctive relief.
