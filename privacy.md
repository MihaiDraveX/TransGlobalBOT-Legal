# Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** August 21, 2025  
**Scope:** This policy explains how **TransGlobalBOT** (“we”, “us”) processes information when you use the Discord application and related services.

## 1. Summary
- **We minimize data.** We process only what is necessary to provide features you enable.  
- **No sale of data.** We do not sell or rent personal data.  
- **Transparency & control.** Server owners control feature configuration; users may exercise rights where applicable.  
- **Security-first.** Encryption in transit and restricted access help protect your data.

## 2. Data Controller & Contact
The operator of TransGlobalBOT is the data controller for processing described here.  
**Contact:** **[mihaidravex@outlook.com]** • Support: **[Discord Invite Link](https://discord.gg/jAA2FFctaM)**

## 3. What We Process
Depending on which features you use, we may process:
- **Discord identifiers**: server ID, channel ID, role IDs, user ID, and username.  
- **Command payloads**: parameters sent with slash commands or button interactions.  
- **Operational logs**: timestamps, error traces, and event types used for reliability and abuse prevention (short-lived).  
- **Optional feature data**: convoy schedules, event metadata, or configuration you explicitly save.

> We do **not** build advertising profiles and do not track users across third-party services.

## 4. Purposes & Legal Bases (GDPR)
- **Provide and improve the Service** (Art. 6(1)(b) contract; Art. 6(1)(f) legitimate interests).  
- **Security and abuse prevention** (Art. 6(1)(f) legitimate interests).  
- **Compliance with legal obligations** (Art. 6(1)(c)).  
- **Optional features** that require additional data may rely on **consent** (Art. 6(1)(a)), which you can withdraw at any time.

## 5. Retention
- **Operational logs**: retained for a short period for troubleshooting, then deleted or anonymized.  
- **Configuration data**: kept while the bot is installed in your server and deleted when removed or on request by the server owner.  
- **Support communications**: retained as needed to resolve issues.

## 6. Sharing & Sub‑Processors
We may use trusted hosting or infrastructure providers to operate the Service (e.g., cloud servers). These providers act as **processors** under data protection law and are bound by appropriate agreements. We do not share personal data with third parties for their independent marketing.

## 7. International Transfers
If data is processed outside your jurisdiction, we rely on appropriate safeguards (e.g., **SCCs**) and implement technical and organizational measures to protect it.

## 8. Your Rights
Subject to applicable law (e.g., GDPR), you may have the right to **access**, **rectify**, **erase**, **restrict**, **object**, and **data portability**. You may also lodge a complaint with your local supervisory authority. To exercise rights, contact us with your Discord **user ID** and the **server ID** where you use the bot.

## 9. Children
The Service is intended for users who meet **Discord’s minimum age** requirements. We do not knowingly process data from children under that threshold.

## 10. Security
We apply reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards: HTTPS/TLS, least-privilege access, secret rotation, and monitoring. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## 11. Changes
We will update this policy as the Service evolves. Material changes will be announced on this site, and the “Effective date” will be revised.

## 12. Contact
Questions or requests? Contact: **[mihaidravex@outlook.com]** • Support: **[Discord Invite Link](https://discord.gg/jAA2FFctaM)**.
